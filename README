#Costguard

OpenAI-compatible AI gateway that reduces LLM costs with smart routing, caching, and usage tracking.

## Why Costguard?

AI applications often:
- Overuse expensive models
- Regenerate identical responses
- Have no visibility into cost per request
- Lack budget guardrails

Costguard sits between your app and your LLM provider to:
- Route requests intelligently
- Cache repeated prompts
- Track token usage and estimated cost
- Enforce cost policies

## Architecture

App → Costguard → LLM Provider

Costguard is designed to be a lightweight, drop-in gateway.

## MVP Features
